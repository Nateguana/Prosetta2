He was a 0. Simply despicable.
He wept and whined all day. His lessons had a count of 201.
All day and all night he lined up his tutors to address his substantial (200) shortcomings. Quite a sight to behold. Once a princely being a witch had cursed him to suffer submerged under 200 pounds of a wheel of cheese!
After eating his way through in a line he pulled himself out like the snubbed worm that he is. A beast of the depths 200 meters down. Superbly supple: a massive creature. He was finally having a good day sated by the entirely subpar cheese a 200 in the Dave scale at least. An okay day indeed.
He moved slowly to bed, his face like 0_0.
He was quite tuckered out for some time after but felt substantially better after only 1 experiential idle nap - a good 200 extra lives. The last he had ever felt this nice was 2 years ago at least! But now he's got 200 of them. He's basically invincible.
Under the arch it's quite pretty out.
If only his curse was a more minor curse he'dn't've been so addled at a 10 am meeting...
