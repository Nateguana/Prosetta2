The waves rose ten yards out from the sea.
The storm of the dark red moon had taken our best men.
The open waters pulled them into the depths!
The water whipped at the boat,
		releasing its rose-tinted wood three-hundred fathoms below.
	The wreck of the Summer Rose left few survivors.
    Nature's tide had taken forty-five men and left only 2.
    The storm gave no respite.
    As the waters rose, those who were left abandoned the 
    Summer Rose and swam 10 hours before finding rescue!
It is truly a miracle that they lived.

    This was actually really easy! Syntax highlighting + word suggestions helped a lot.
        Debugging sometimes took like 30 seconds, whereas before it would always take a couple minutes at least.
        Just bc syntax highlighting tells me when things aren't parsing immediately, and also immediately tells
        me when I accidentally triggered something I didn't want to.
    I really enjoyed using Rose both as the flower and the past tense of rise.
    And the thing it drew looked like a rose.
