Literary Rain
By Milo Jacobs, John Framingham, and Jill Graphton.

Stories are always a push and pull
		between the subjective and the literal; 
        a delicate balance...
A whisper from the 
		flowers pushes past 
        		similarity; an oppressive philosophy ---
	It runs towards now. The modern standard 
    		is a performance of a melody pushing into reality --- 
            a reality of authenticity ---
	Now we wash away the subjective in favor of the 
    		literal; an oppressive philosophy.
            A time of two choices: now and know ---
	But if you remove and push away the metaphor,
    you march to an empty score.
	Stories are always a push and pull between 
    		standard and new. 
            To choose is to push one's ability to write ---
    Paint fields blue with ink!
