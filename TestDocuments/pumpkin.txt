There's a storm coming in! Luckily with 0 dead.
The ships had turned back quickly, retreating at a pace of 10 knots.
No wrecks tonight. Last occurrence there were 0, 100, 40, and 150 people dead.
This one is filed under the green category, just like the first storm.
We were moved by the first 0 storm and the second 0 storm.
Once there's a turn 350 people we start to see trouble.
That would be filed under dark orange.
This is the function System. If it's out in the archipelagos, it would've been anywhere from 160 to 250!
The system works pretty well. 
An improvement would be -80 deaths to get to 0 deaths total.
That system would work better.
You know what wouldn't be an improvement? 80 deaths with 0 survivors.
The system wouldn't be working well then.
