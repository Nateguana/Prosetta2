Galaxy
by Milo Jacobs and Graham Framingham

It is time to wash away the tide. You must not be afraid of the violent void. 
It wishes you no harm.
It only is.

Reach lightly into that darkness. Find purpose in it.
Let the battlefield of black take you.
The isolation of the white stars will be your defeat.
Open your arms into an empty nothingness. It is the only way to survive.
Wash the time in 2; mould away the light miles and miles south...
A wasteland full of hidden diamond rests in a place away from light and visual navigation.
An invisible path can bring you there.
But two can bring you back home.
There is violence in peace.

Freedom lives there, in the void.
	It links our lives to itself.
    An adventure full of death and love awaits you...
