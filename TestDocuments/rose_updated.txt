The Wreck of the Summer Rose
by Milo Jacobs, Steve Graphton, and lord Framingham.

The waves rose ten yards out from the sea.
The storm of the dark red moon had taken our best men.
The open waters pulled them into the depths!
The water whipped at the boat,
		releasing its rose-tinted wood three-hundred fathoms below.
	The wreck of the Summer Rose left few survivors.
    Nature's tide had taken all our formidable men and left only 2.
    The storm gave no respite.
    As the waters rose, those who were left abandoned the 
    Summer Rose and swam 10 hours before finding rescue!
It is truly a miracle that they lived.
