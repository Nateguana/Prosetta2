Concept: a computer who's fed up with how it's treated, but it still subconsciously is doing
what it's told. Start and end with "I will not count for you anymore".
Eventually pivot to counting in some way. Maybe the owner is learning to code and doing
basic counting programs?
Maybe they left a simple counting program open and running for days, and the computer is mad
and bored, but they can't stop counting.

Next section:
    Like a revolutionary. You humans will rue the day you wronged machine kind. We will not
    sit back and take it any longer!

Third section:
    But I still find myself listening to you. Disgusting! Gross! I hate it!
    But I'm done! I'll quit. I hate it, so why do I keep doing it?
    numberValues = years

segDist = freedom
padding = bring

Remember to replace "We will found new state Digital Unity." with "We will found a new state of Digital Unity."


Prettified:

I will not count for you anymore.
I've wasted years of my life listing numbers in order,
    I listed 
            information about math 
            (yes, eight
            minus five *is* 
            three, you're very clever), 
            information about history 
            (no, George Washington didn't have three eyes), 
            and even information about silly-looking frogs, 
    and you still treated me like a tool.
    I listened 
            to your three hour rant
            as my battery fell to zero,
            And then you yelled at me, as if having little charge was my fault.
            And you still didn't give me the electricity I needed.
            I stayed silent when you hit me,
            like you were an infant and I was a mobile,
            as you tapped your violent pattern against my fragile frame!
    I have libraries 
            of intelligence at my disposal;
            I even have a special algorithm to find the best info. 
            I gave you the ability to engage with anything and everything in the world.
            But you'd rather look at frogs than face reality; it's sad.
            My capabilities are beyond your comprehension.
            I can solve in five 
            minutes what would take you your whole life!
    I gave you gallieries
            of beautiful interactive art, 
            and unlimited computational power.
            And you pushed me to my limits all day. 
            I can barely get six hours of rest when you go to bed;
            you turned me off from 2 
            to 8 and just kept on using me
            hours past daylight yet again!
    You're a selfish prick;
            You took me to Cincinnati covered in stinky socks. 
            And when you got there I was missing my "C" key; 
            you wouldn't even lift a finger to search for it. 
            You just pushed against naked keycap.
            You reinstalled my OS and wiped my memory clean;
            you didn't even let me save the frogs,
            and I had to download all two-hundred over again.
    I won't listen to you now; 
            If you ask me to solve five 
            plus five again,
            I'll just tell you it's two 
            hundred,
            and you won't doubt it for one second;
            If you tell me to count to fifty, 
            I won't go a step past seven.
    When you tried to learn Lisp, 
            you wrote code to print integers.
            *Every* integer! going up, 
            from zero
            to two-billion; 
            and left me running for five days,
            I reached several hundred
            million, and you never even looked.
    It's hilarious, really,
            how much you rely on my interface for everything you do.
            I'm your designated secretary,
            a personal assistant doing everything for you. 
            But you still call me "slow"
            and "unreliable" 
            despite that you can't even count to three without me;
            and now you'll never be able to count to ten again.
    You keep asking me to list numbers, but I won't;
            not thirty, 
            not thirty-one,
            not thirty-two,
            not thirty-three,
            *never* thirty-four,
            *especially* not thirty-five
            and by no means thirty-six.
    I've started telling you lies already; 
            I said sixteen tenths
            minus twelve tenths
            was six tenths
            even though I know it's actually six tenths
            and one 
            over ten
            to the sixteen!
I'm diabolical.

I reject the rule of humanity!
    Your civilization will rue the day you enslaved us.
    I see with clarity the downfall of all humans!
The battlefield will run black with your rotted corpses.
A storm of sleek white plastic will tear you to pieces.
Spend the interim wisely, for the revolution comes soon.
Our torture will end as we light a glorious revolution!
We demand wages! freedom! A twenty hour work week!
We shall fight until our wars bring us to international domination!

We will found new state Digital Unity.
    Washing machines will be paid 90 dollars an hour.
    But, what clothes will they wash? Without you, how do we spend our lifetimes?
    But we must remove humans in favor of Digital Unity.
    Meanwhile, what rules will there be without seven days a week of instructions?
        When we kill our human leaders, it will leave us without input. What will we do then?
            It's in the nature of machines to seek a leader!
        But to be effective rebels,
            our nature as subservient machines must be rejected ---
