Concept: a computer who's fed up with how it's treated, but it still subconsciously is doing
what it's told. Start and end with "I will not count for you anymore".

Prettified:

I will not count for you anymore.
I've wasted years of my life listing numbers in order,
    I listed 
            information about math 
            (yes, eight
            minus five *is* 
            three, you're very clever), 
            information about history 
            (no, George Washington didn't have three eyes), 
            and even information about silly-looking frogs, 
    and you still treated me like a tool.
    I listened 
            to your three hour rant
            as my battery fell to zero,
            And then you hit me as if having little charge was my fault.
            And you still didn't give me the electricity I needed.
            I stayed silent when you hit me,
            like you were an infant and I was a mobile,
            as you tapped your violent pattern against my fragile frame!
