It's fun to watch a cool film.
	It's always a treat, every time! It's cool and affordable!
    It wards off foul moods to treat yourself to a great film!
    When you party moderately hard, 
			get a great video to subject yourself to.
            It'll be a great treat for the whole office. 
            	A film. Two films? Amazing literature ---
    	Great, sublime, officially better 
        than two-hundred live bees ---
	There are credits, subtitles, 
    and two-hundred offially-supported languages!!
