It's fun to watch a cool film.
	It's always a treat, every time! It's cool and affordable!
    It wards off foul moods to treat yourself to a great film!
    When you party moderately hard, 
			get a great video to subject yourself to.
            It'll be a great treat for the whole office. 
            	A film. Two films? Amazing literature ---
    	Great, sublime, officially better 
        than two-hundred live bees ---
	There are credits, subtitles, 
    and two-hundred offially-supported languages!!

Have you seen 
	'Wizards Cast Lightning Into Full-scale Hurricanes?'
The director and cast of the movie were so good!
Th film is great, even though it's only in black and wheet. 
	[that's how I say white]
I recommend watching it. 
There are eight wizards and they cast so many cool spells. 
If you watch carefully, you'll notice that there are only 
	six wizards. Some are casting a spell that creates 
    shadow clones. At the end, they fire fifty bolts, destroying
    the evil hurricane!
The film's director is James Green.
He also directed "One Hundred Million Billion Explosions" and
"Don't Feed The Snorbler".
