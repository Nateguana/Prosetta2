I found I was happy with zero cares in the world. Here I am, simply having a great life.
The whimsicality just never lessened, I'm happy, 100%.
Everyone was happy and I had skedaddled with a happy one person combo meal. I ate it quite happily.
I did a wheelie on my epic and also awesome sparkling modded happy bicycle with 3 different colors on it. I've zero regrets. I went and parked it on amberwoord street. People were happy to look at it for 5 minutes then wandered away. Soon there were 0 people left. Oh well.
Everyone's so sportingly Fizzbuzz!
Occasionally I like to cast spells that implores wheat to grow sparingly. This makes the moderators happy three times over. I've never seen anything quite like it, like a submarine fight one on one. Quite the sight to behold.
Honestly I'm rambling a lot now bubbling like Sprite fizz. Really just all over the place.
I don't think this piece is getting any better else I'd continue this whole paragraph with great aplomb moondancing as happy as can be like me 5 years ago. Oh well there's essentially zero reason to keep going with this.
Even if I do get prideful buzz. It simply can't go on for much longer.
May as well end on some good elements that prize happy... happiness
