I was lonely as the subject pointed his hand. His finger vanished into the dark...
    (was "lonely" (sub (int "his") (int "the")))
He was but a naive little one, that boy.
    (was "but" (lit one))
He wasted days pleading against a vast, empty void.
    (was "days" (int "a"))
There was no answer.
    (was "no")
I worship the empty miles between lonely light and a hundred years' darkness,
    (whi (les "lonely" (lit hundred)
in the space between spaces.
        )
I stayed
        (statement 
in the emptiness darkness provides but I didn't linger.
            (pri "but")
I wasted no days with my idolatry.
            (was "no" "days")
Wars waged as days advanced but days were too fast. Soon they slowed to centuries.
            (was "days" (add "but" "days"))
The boy was naive but no fool.
            (was "but" "no")

            (was "lonely" (add "lonely" (lit one)))

No control flow. Let's draw a smiley face again.

The wizards utter 'paint iambically.'
The peasants hadn't choice but to obey.
    (was "utter" (int "iambically") -- 10
    )
    I'm thinking double quotes should be how we enter a string, but we might want dialogue 
    as code sometimes, so perhaps single quotes can be ignored.

The wizards' cruel entertainments chant
and utter utter nonsense, void of weight.
    (was "cruel" (tim 
    utter utter)) -- 100

The wizards' cursed victims utter trash;
the mages stand offended that despite
intent most fair, the peasants: they dissent!
    (was "cursed" (tim utter 

    (int "most"))) -- 40
    The colon couldn't close any function so it is ignored
    Cursed pronounced the two syllable way: "cur-sed"
    I'm doubting the punctuation rule for closing statements.
    It becomes bothersome when (a) you need to close multiple statements, and when
    (b) you need a pause but you can't close your sentence yet.
    For now, I've simply decided semicolons and hyphens will be ignored.

The wizards think it boon to speak in verse
but overestimate the peasant's skill;
'there is no point to it' the peasants thought.
'What cruel poetry they thrust on us.'
And so the peasants organized revolt.
    (was "think" 
    (tim 
    (int 2) 
    cruel)
    ) -- 200


(arc think think think)
(arc cruel think cursed)
(arc (add think cruel) think cursed)
(arc (add think cruel) (add think cruel) (add think cruel))
