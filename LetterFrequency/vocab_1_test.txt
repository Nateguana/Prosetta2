I wasted months seeking jobs with zero progress.
    (was months (lit 0))
Was there anything I could do? I felt like I had fallen into a hole with no escape...
    (was there (int "a"))
Was it worth even trying anymore? Could this application be the one that succeeded?
    (was it (lit 1))
I began wishing for some sort of release. Months dragged on and time continued. Minutes obediently marched forward, as minutes habitually do. Applying, hoping, waiting.
    (whi (les months (tim (int "obediently") (int "habitually")))
Until I met The Muffin Man, the man whose restaurant saved my life.
    (sta
He's a perfect professional; there isn't anything he can't do.
    (pri there)
His chocolate muffin was unmatched; it tasted like a thousand years of happiness.
    (was unmatched it)
Once he makes a muffin, he wraps it in a hand-made foil. There is a great joy to it all!
    (was it (add there it))
I worked as one of the waiters there in his unmatched muffin bakery.
    (was there unmatched)
These were the wackiest months of my life, too. I graduated a few months later into a role of deputy chef. In that role I had to whisper a poem to each muffin, tuck the batter in at night, and mix dozens of kinds of sugar in perfect ratios.
    (was months (add months (int 1)))
Though his methods were questionable, the results weren't. The Muffin Man and I made the best muffins in the world.

I was lonely as the subject pointed his hand. His finger vanished into the dark...
    (was "lonely" (sub (int "his") (int "the")))
He was but a naive little one, that boy.
    (was "but" (lit one))
He wasted days pleading against a vast, empty void.
    (was "days" (int "a"))
There was no answer.
    (was "no")
I worship the empty miles between lonely light and a hundred years' darkness,
    (whi (les "lonely" (lit hundred)
in the space between spaces.
        )
I stayed
        (statement 
in the emptiness darkness provides but I didn't linger.
            (pri "but")
I wasted no days with my idolatry.
            (was "no" "days")
Wars waged as days advanced but days were too fast. Soon they slowed to centuries.
            (was "days" (add "but" "days"))
The boy was naive but no fool.

No control flow. Let's draw a smiley face again.

The wizards utter 'paint iambically.'
The peasants hadn't choice but to obey.
    (was "utter" (int "iambically") -- 10
    )
    I'm thinking double quotes should be how we enter a string, but we might want dialogue 
    as code sometimes, so perhaps single quotes can be ignored.

The wizards' cruel entertainments chant
and utter utter nonsense, void of weight.
    (was "cruel" (tim 
    utter utter)) -- 100

The wizards' cursed victims utter trash;
the mages stand offended that despite
intent most fair, the peasants: they dissent!
    (was "cursed" (tim utter 

    (int "most"))) -- 40
    The colon couldn't close any function so it is ignored
    Cursed pronounced the two syllable way: "cur-sed"
    I'm doubting the punctuation rule for closing statements.
    It becomes bothersome when (a) you need to close multiple statements, and when
    (b) you need a pause but you can't close your sentence yet.
    For now, I've simply decided semicolons and hyphens will be ignored.

The wizards thought it boon to speak in verse
but overestimate the peasant's skill;
'there is no point to it' the peasants thought.
'What cruel poetry they thrust on us.'
And so the peasants organized revolt.
    (was "thought" 
    (tim 
    (int 2) 
    cruel)
    ) -- 200

They searched for mages speaking just in verse;
they thought and thought and thought 'where could they be?'
    (arc 
    thought thought thought)

But long had passed; magicians marched away
from cruel bitter thought and cursed man.
    (arc 
    cruel thought cursed)

And so in lack of overlords but yet
still wrought by curse the agriculturists
admitted thought that life is not so bad.
Despite new vocal eccentricities
their burdens lifted free of mages cruel.
They thought that they were cursed, but in fact
    (arc 
    (add thought ~~"not so bad."~~
    cruel) 
    thought cursed)

the wizards had abandoned cruel thought,
and left the peasants free of emperor.
    (was "had" (add cruel thought)
    )

And so their revolution had achieved
a world where peasants had to speak in verse
but answered not to any cruel lord
for they had long since gone, with nothing left
but a society that slowly learned
restriction fosters creativity.

    but a society that slowly learned
