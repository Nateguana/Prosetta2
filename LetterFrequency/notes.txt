Data set from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/english-word-frequency?resource=download

Given a set of aliases, go through each word and find which, if any, aliases it triggers
If a word triggers an alias, add its frequency to that alias's score. A word can trigger multiple aliases
Generate a pie chart breaking down the frequencies for single words.

If you have time, try it for each sequence of two words. See if the results change. You'd add the product
of their frequencies in order to be consistent. Well this would work if the frequencies were normalized
but they're not. probably for the best given the size of the numbers.
