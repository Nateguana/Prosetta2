# Sub - Subtract

Subtraction operator. Subtracts one number from another, then returns the new value. If provided only one argument, multiplies it by negative one and returns the new value. Unlike in other languages, this must be in prefix notation, meaning the word containing "sub" as a subsequence must come before the numbers subtracted.

## Arguments

### One-Argument Opposite
```n (number)```

### Standard
```n1 (number), n2 (number)```
