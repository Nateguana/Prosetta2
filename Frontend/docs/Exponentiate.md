# Exp - Exponentiate

Exponentiation operator, equivalent to JavaScript's **. Unlike in other languages, this must be in prefix notation, meaning the word containing "exp" as a subsequence must come before the exponentiated numbers. If only one argument is specified, the base is assumed to be e.

## Arguments

### Standard
```base (number), exp (number)```

### e^x
```exp (number)```

## Example

Was that an exponent of 10 to 100 okay?
