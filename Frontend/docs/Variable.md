# Was - Variable Assign

Assigns a variable a given value. This works equally for initial assignment of a variable as it does for reassignment. The first word after the "was" alias will be the variable's name, and the next expression afterwards will be its value.

## Arguments

```name (word), value (any)```

## Example
<editor :code="`
