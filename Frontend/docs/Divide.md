# Ide - Divide

Division operator. Given two numbers, divides the first by the second. Unlike in other languages, this must be in prefix notation, meaning the word containing "ide" as a subsequence must come before the divided numbers. 

## Arguments

```n1 (number), n2 (number)```

## Example
<editor :code='`
was var ide 1 2..
pri var.
`' 
:code-wordier="`
