Adds two or more numbers together and returns the total value. Unlike in other languages, this must be in prefix notation, meaning the word containing "add" as a subsequence must come before all added numbers.

## Arguments

```num1 (required, number), num2 (required, number), n3, n4, n5 â€¦ (numbers)```
