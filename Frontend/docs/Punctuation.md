# Punctuation

Think of punctuation as Prosetta's equivalent to a closed parenthesis. When commands end, you must close them with a piece of punctuation. Some punctuation closes multiple commands at once.

## Period (.) and Colon (:)

Periods and colons close one command each.

## Comma (,) and Semicolon (;)

Commas and semicolons close one command each __only if the function it is closing can take no further arguments.__ This allows you to add punctuation without closing an open function, especially one with many overrides.

## Question Marks (?) and Exclamation Points (!)

Question marks and exclamation points close two commands each.

## N-Dashes (--)

Since Prosetta only supports ASCII encoding, n-dashes are represented as two consecutive hyphens (--). They close two commands each.

## M-Dashes (---)
	
Since Prosetta only supports ASCII encoding, n-dashes are represented as three consecutive hyphens (---). They close three commands each.

## Ellipses (...)

Ellipses are represented through three periods (rather than the ellipsis unicode character). They close 10 commands each and so are particularly useful for closing large amounts of commands at once.
